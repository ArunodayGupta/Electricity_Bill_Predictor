I am using Random Forest Model to predict the Electricity Bill based on the given data.
First, we read the csv file.
second, split the data in training and testing data.
third, dividing the columns based on numeric and categorical columns.
Fourth, Using min max scaler to normalize the data and scaling the numeric columns based on it.
Fifth, using the onehotencoder to encode the categorical columns.
sixth, using the random forest Model to predict the electricity bill.
